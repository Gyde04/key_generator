# RSA Key Generator

A Python-based tool that generates RSA public and private key pairs using the cryptography library. This tool provides a secure way to generate cryptographic keys for various security applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Generates 2048-bit RSA key pairs
- Creates both public and private keys in PEM format
- Secure key generation using industry-standard cryptography library
- Simple and easy-to-use implementation
- Automatic key file creation

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gyde04/key_generator.git
cd key_generator

  2. Install required packages

bashCopypip3 install cryptography
💻 Usage

 Run the script:

bashCopypython3 generate_keys.py

The script will generate two files:


private_key.pem: Contains the private key
public_key.pem: Contains the public key

The keys will also be displayed in the terminal for immediate viewing.
📁 Output Format
The generated keys are in PEM format:
Private Key
Copy-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
[Base64 encoded private key]
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
Public Key
Copy-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
[Base64 encoded public key]
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
🔐 Security Considerations

Never share your private key
Store private keys in a secure location
Use appropriate file permissions to protect key files
Consider encrypting private keys with a password for additional security
Keep your cryptography library updated to the latest version
